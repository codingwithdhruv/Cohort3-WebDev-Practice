# Harkirat's Cohort 3 Web Dev Practice

-----

This repository is my dynamic workspace for practicing and solidifying web development concepts from **Harkirat Singh's Web Development Cohort 3**. Instead of a rigid curriculum structure, this repo serves as a personal sandbox for tackling **specific topics and challenges I need to practice most**.

## 🚀 About This Repo

This isn't a linear progression through every single module; it's a focused environment where I'll:

  * **Dive Deep into Specific Concepts:** Implement code for topics where I need extra practice or a clearer understanding.
  * **Solve Targeted Problems:** Work through particular challenges, algorithms, or design patterns relevant to web development.
  * **Experiment Freely:** Try out new techniques, libraries, or approaches without the pressure of a fixed project.

The goal is to reinforce learning through hands-on coding, focusing precisely on the areas that require the most attention.

## 📚 Technologies & Concepts (Flexible Focus)

While I'm primarily learning from Harkirat's Cohort 3, this repository will feature practice in a **flexible range of web development technologies and concepts** based on my individual learning needs. This might include, but isn't limited to:

### Frontend

  * **HTML5 & CSS3** (especially advanced layouts like Flexbox/Grid, responsive design)
  * **JavaScript** (ES6+ features, asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation)
  * **React.js** (components, hooks, state management patterns, routing)
  * Frontend tooling and build processes

### Backend

  * **Node.js & Express.js** (API design, middleware, routing)
  * **Databases** (SQL like PostgreSQL, NoSQL like MongoDB – schema design, queries)
  * **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, session management)
  * Working with various APIs

### General Web Dev

  * **Git & GitHub** workflows
  * Deployment strategies
  * Performance optimization
  * Basic security considerations

The specific files and folders will reflect the concepts I'm actively practicing at any given time.

## 📁 Repository Structure (Ad-hoc)

Given the flexible nature, the structure of this repository will be **ad-hoc and topic-driven**. You won't find a strict `module-x` organization. Instead, expect folders or files named after the specific concepts or challenges I'm working on, for example:

```
.
├── css-flexbox-playground/
├── react-context-api-example/
├── express-middleware-practice/
├── mongo-aggregation-queries/
├── jwt-auth-flow/
├── custom-webpack-config-test/
└── README.md
```

Each specific practice area might contain its own `README.md` with notes, explanations, or specific instructions for that topic.

## 🌱 Progress & Updates

This repo will evolve as I progress through Cohort 3 and identify new areas for practice. Commits will reflect my ongoing efforts to master different web development topics.
